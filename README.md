## Description

The Hangman Game is a JavaScript project that allows users to play the classic game of Hangman. The game starts by generating a random word from a predefined list of words. The player's objective is to guess the word by selecting letters one at a time.

The game displays a hangman pole and figure using SVG to visually represent the player's progress. The correct letters guessed by the player are displayed in the UI, while the wrong letters are shown separately. If the player selects a letter twice, a notification is displayed to inform them.

When the player successfully guesses the word, a popup message is shown to indicate a win. Conversely, if the player runs out of chances without guessing the word, a popup message is shown to indicate a loss. The player can then choose to play again by clicking the "Play Again" button, which resets the game.

## Usage
